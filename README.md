# Sentiment-Analysis-Python

This project performs textual analysis on the financial reports to drive sentiment opinion, sentiment scores, readability etc.

The project is categorized into 3 Parts:
1.	Data Extraction
2.	Data Parsing
3.	Textual Analysis

Data Extraction is done by extracting data from links containing SEC EDGAR financial reports.

Data Parsing involves organizing the extracted data into easily readable text by removing unnecessary HTML tags, non-significant words in the report.

Textual Analysis includes all the necessary steps taken to analyse the sentiment score of the text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, only on 3 different sections i.e. Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis (MDA), Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (QQDMR), and Risk Factors (RF), in each report.
